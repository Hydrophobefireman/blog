Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/

## Problem 
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans` of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n` (**0-indexed**).

Specifically, `ans` is the **concatenation** of two `nums` arrays.

Return _the array_ `ans`.

## Intuition
I am not really sure how to break it down more than it already is, just gotta return the array+array. 
```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn get_concatenation(mut nums: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
        nums.extend(nums.clone());
        nums
    }
}

```
If you don't want to modify the array, you can imperatively append numbers in a loop but that's about it.
