Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-elements-with-greatest-element-on-right-side/

## Problem
Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.


## Intuition
We simply need to track the largest number from the right. It's a `scan` operation.
All we do is iterate backwards and set the current largest number in our state variable and assign it to the array.

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn replace_elements(arr: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut res = vec![0; arr.len()];
        let it = arr.iter().rev().scan(-1, |state, it| {
            let res = Some(*state);
            *state = *it.max(state);
            res
        });
        for (a, b) in res.iter_mut().rev().zip(it) {
            *a = b
        }
        res
    }
}

```

### Unsafe?
Considering that we will never go out of bounds during this function, we can make our code much faster by utilizing unsafe:
```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn replace_elements(mut arr: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut max = -1;
        let n = arr.len();
        for i in (0..n).rev() {
            let t = max;
            max = i32::max(*unsafe { arr.get_unchecked(i) }, max);
            arr[i] = t;
        }
        arr
    }
}

```
